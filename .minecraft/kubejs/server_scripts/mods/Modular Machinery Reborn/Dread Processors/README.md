# Dread Processors

mmmmmmmmmmm Insanely fast machines, my favorite

naw but in seriousness, Dread Processors are just a MB, 64 in 1 second version of their SB counterpart - and will be needed in the endgame as there will be some recipes locked to the MB.

### Current Full list of Dread Processors:

* Circuit Dream (AE2): Implemented but cant actually craft yet
* ALloy Smelter (Enderio): Not Implemented yet
* Empowerer (Actually Additions): Implemented but same as circuit dream
* Infusing Factory (Mekanism): Not Implemented yet
* Enriching Factory (Mekanism): Not implemented yet
* And so much more as i discover more that need one.
