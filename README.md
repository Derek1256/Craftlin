# Project: Craftlin


Project: Craftlin is a heavy technology focused modpack based in the version of 1.21, the ultimate goal will be to 100% the quest book. some key things to note: AE2 Channels are turned off, (can be turned back on) to make the difference from RS to AE pretty much nothing, apart from the obvious mod themselfs differences. **we have custom miners**. which will aid you in the late game when you have maxxed out mekanism 3-4x ore proc.

Features & Edits:
* 10 tiers of custom miners (WIP)
* Quest book (aiming  for 600+ Quests when done)
